Style and Colors
================

These are guidelines for using the Dask logo with community-approved color palettes
and typography.

Logos
-----
Logos for Dask are available at :doc:`logos`. The Dask logo is made up of two components:
The Logo Mark and the Word Mark, which together make up the Horizontal Logo. Using the Logo
Mark alone should be reserved for instances where the Horizontal Logo is already present,
or as an avatar when “Dask” appears alongside the Logo Mark in plain text.

Additional logo considerations:

   :alt: Horizontal Logo with x-height marked to the lower-left, upper-right, and center-right.
   
   In layout, make sure there is enough clearspace on all sides of the logo by using the x-height.

.. figure:: images/logo-size.png
   :alt: Examples of three resized versions of the Horizontal Logo (left) and Logo Mark (right) in descending size order.
   
   When resizing the Horizontal Logo or Logo Mark, the minimum widths should be 75 pixels (1-inch)
   and 20 pixels, respectively, to ensure legibliity.

   :alt: Two columns and three rows of variations of the Horizontal Logo.
   
   There are a number of logo variations to ensure adequate contrast with the background color.

   What **not** to do to the logo: (1) Compress horizontally or vertically, (2) Rotate,
   (3) Recolor, (4) Disassemble, (5) Add strokes or outlines,
   (6) Place on an unapproved background color.

Typography
----------
Roboto and Roboto Mono are the primary Dask typefaces. Roboto is best for
for H-level titles and longform body copy. Roboto Mono should be used when
displaying syntax/code snippets or as a labeling device for charts, graphics,
and specialty layout components.

Colors
------
For colors, we typically choose from the orange gradient on the Logo Mark
itself (shown in top right-hand corner of the figure below).
You can use the following grid to select color for text, graphical elements,
and general layout. Note that text should meet a "Pass" qualification to meet AA (or AAA) requirements.

   Hex codes for primary palette (left to right): #FDA061, #1D1D1D, #3772FF, #AFCBFF,
   #E2E4F6, #35644D, #9CAFB7. Hex codes for secondary palette (left ot right): #FDD3A6,
   #FFF7E7, #FE6939, #0135B4, #E1F4E6, #C3D9E2, #62636C.
