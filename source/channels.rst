Communication Channels
======================

Currently the Dask project communicate with the general public through a few
different media

Twitter
-------

The `@dask_dev <https://twitter.com/dask_dev>`_ Twitter account is available to
promote information like the following:

1.  New releases or important features that arrive in the Dask project
2.  Important or interesting uses of Dask in the broader community
3.  Documentation, talks, blogposts, or other knowledge artifacts produced
    by Dask contributors in the past that remain relevant but may not be
    broadly known.

However, as with any communication medium we should beware of misusing the
twitter account.  In particular

1.  We tend not to broadcast for-profit promotional or sales material.
    It is important that Dask's brand remains trusted and neutral to corporate
    interests.

    That being said, we do not mind retweeting for-profit products if there is
    not a conflict of interest, and if those products are likely of value to
    our users.  This is often a judgment call.  We endeavor to remove conflicts
    of interest from those making these judgements.

2.  We tend not to over-broadcast, out of respect for those that subscribe.

Trusted members of the Dask community are given access to the `@dask_dev
<https://twitter.com/dask_dev>`_ team account through
https://tweetdeck.twitter.com .  On this site they can operate either as their
personal account or the Dask account either by authoring their own tweets or
interacting with existing tweets.  We also endeavor to maintain a
one-tweet-per-day schedule of existing content.  Often sourced from our
documentation, examples, stories, blog, or Youtube channel.

Here are some suggestions to guide new tweeters in this process:

1.  Aim for no more than one or two tweets per day, out of respect for our subscribers
2.  Try to include an image in the tweet to help it stand out
3.  Engage with the tweet yourself, perhaps by adding personal context in a
    reply.  People seem to be more willing to engage with a tweet once someone
    else has broken the ice.
4.  Be mindful of the time that the tweet will occur.  If you're aiming for a
    particular region of the world (like the US) then you may want to target
    times during the day, and in particular during commuting hours.
5.  Anecdotally, people seem to engage more in the middle of the work week, and
    less on Monday (presumably they're busy), Friday afternoon and Saturday
    (hopefully they have something better to do).
6.  Mix up content a bit.  We can keep our messaging fresh by interleaving
    documentation content with blogs and videos.

If you are a member of the Dask community and wish to maintain the Twitter
account, please get in contact with a core maintainer for access.  If you are
just looking to get content retweeted the simplest thing you can do is include
`@dask_dev` in your tweet (we track tweets that mention the account), and make
sure that your tweet follows our :doc:`tone` guidelines.

Blog
----

The Dask blog is published at `blog.dask.org/ <https://blog.dask.org/>`_ with
an Atom feed at `blog.dask.org/atom.xml <https://blog.dask.org/atom.xml>`_.

Content resides at `github.com/dask/dask-blog <https://github.com/dask/dask-blog>`_
and anyone can contribute content by submitting a pull request with markdown
or HTML to that repository (markdown preferred).

In particular we highly encourage Dask users to contribute stories of
how they have used Dask to solve interesting problems.


Youtube
-------

The `Dask Youtube channel
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj9eavqmvwaCyKhIlu2GaoA?view_as=subscriber>`_
holds content that we generate as part of our documentation.
We also maintain `playlists to other Dask talks
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj9eavqmvwaCyKhIlu2GaoA/playlists?view_as=subscriber>`_

For Dask contributors looking to produce screencast content we encourage the
following tips:

1.  Get a good microphone.  Headset microphones often cost around $30, and have
    a large impact on audio quality.
2.  Turn off external stimuli that might interrupt your recording, including
    calendar, e-mail, and messaging notifications
3.  Consider going full screen to remove clock and OS dock bars
4.  Speak clearly and at a moderate pace.
    Speaking too quickly can exclude users for whom English is a second
    language (assuming that you are speaking in English) while speaking too
    slowly can make a video overly long.
5.  Become comfortable with screen recording software.  On OS-X QuickTime is
    builtin and easy to use.  Select the "New Screen Recording" option, verify
    that your microphone is set up correctly, and press the red Record button.
6.  To upload your video, log into Youtube and press the upload button in the
    upper right, which looks like a camera icon with a ``+`` symbol.  It may
    take Youtube an hour or more to fully process your video.

The Dask Youtube channel is a brand account for which it is easy to share
access to trusted maintainers.  Please contact an existing maintainer if you
would like access.  Alternatively, you can upload your own content and we can
add it to one of the playlists mentioned above.
